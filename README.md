# Geant4 Detector Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Geant4 Detector Project. This project focuses on the design and implementation of both basic and improved detectors using the Geant4 simulation toolkit. The primary objective is to collect particle data and analyze it through traditional and AI-based methods for data reconstruction, destinguishing between incoming electrons and photons of energy ranging from 200 MeV - 20 GeV.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed various detector configurations to study their performance in simulating particle interactions. The detectors are designed to capture a wide range of particle data, which is crucial for understanding fundamental physics processes.

## Key Features

- **Basic and Improved Detectors**: The project includes designs for both basic detectors and enhanced versions that incorporate advanced features for better data collection.
- **Particle Data Collection**: We simulate various particle interactions and collect data, which serves as the foundation for our analysis.
- **Data Reconstruction Methods**: 
  - Traditional Methods: We implement established techniques for data reconstruction to provide a baseline for performance comparison.
  - AI-Based Methods: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we explore innovative approaches to enhance data reconstruction accuracy and efficiency.
