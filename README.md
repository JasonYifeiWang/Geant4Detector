# Geant4 Detector Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Geant4 Detector Project. This project focuses on the design and implementation of both basic and improved detectors using the Geant4 simulation toolkit. The primary objective is to collect particle data and analyze it through traditional and AI-based methods for data reconstruction, destinguishing between incoming electrons and photons of energy ranging from 200 MeV - 20 GeV.

## Key Features

- **Basic and Improved Detectors**: The project includes designs for both basic detectors and enhanced versions for better data collection.
- **Particle Data Collection**: Incoming particles interacts with the detector of different structures and materials, which serves as the foundation for further analysis.
- **Data Reconstruction Methods**: 
  - Traditional Methods: established techniques were used for energy reconstruction to provide a baseline for performance comparison.
  - AI-Based Methods: neuron networks are used to enhance data reconstruction and particle classification.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Results from traditional and AI-based methods are compared to evaluate their effectiveness in reconstructing particle data.
- **More Details**: Details can be found in the file: project3.ipynb

## Getting Started
